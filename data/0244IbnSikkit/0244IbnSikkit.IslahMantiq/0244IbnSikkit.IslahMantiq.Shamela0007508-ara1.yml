90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Deleted editorial introduction and table of contents. I have also deleted footnote markers but may have missed some. I tagged poetry. The text contains identifications of Quran verses (sura + verse number) between square brackets. I have left these in place. I have changed the commas in the text to Arabic commas. Text does not have a directly obvious structure, so I have left everything at first level. Beatrice Gruendler ("The Rice of the Arabic Book" p. 137) notes that the text has 114 chapters, but the present version only has 96.
