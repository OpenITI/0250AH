    (this overview of the editions is based on  Muḥammad bin ʿAbd Allāh al-Salloomi, 
    The Missing and Unpublished Part of the Third Generation of the Ṣaḥābah, 
    PhD thesis, Lampeter: University of Wales, 1996, pp. 67-68,
    https://repository.uwtsd.ac.uk/id/eprint/1029/1/503583.pdf)
    The earliest editions:
    * ed. Sachau et al., Leiden: Brill, 1904-1918. Not in the corpus
    * ed. n.n., Cairo: Dār al-Taḥrīr, 18 vols (based on the Sachau ed.;

      Based on the Sachau/Dār al-Taḥrīr ed.; includes only the indexes,

    All the above editions contain important gaps:

    * the tābiʿūn of Medina
    These gaps were later filled by partial editions based on new manuscripts:
   * al-Ṭabaqa al-thālitha min al-ṣaḥāba, ed. al-Sallūmī, 
      PhD dissertation, Wales University (https://repository.uwtsd.ac.uk/id/eprint/1029/1/503583.pdf).
      Not in the corpus as such.
