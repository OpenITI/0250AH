90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The Shamela version's structure was more conveniently
    pre-formatted already so I annotated this version. Text is fairly clean.
    Hadith numbering has been retained but not tagged. SL: Pagination failed.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
    Link to the text file as it was before it was cleaned:
