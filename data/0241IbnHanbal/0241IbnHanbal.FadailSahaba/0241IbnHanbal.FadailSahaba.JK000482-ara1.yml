90#VERS#COMMENT##: JK version is cleaner than the Shamela one, though
    they are both based on  on the same edition by Waṣī Allāh  b. Maḥmūd
    ʿAbbās. Hadith are numbered but also grouped in thematic sections. Only
    the latter have been tagged. The sama'at from the manuscript  recorded
    on the last pages before the index (pp. 991-994) have not been included
    in the  typed version.
