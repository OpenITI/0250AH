90#VERS#COMMENT##: Digital edition is based on the edition by Waṣī Allāh  b. Maḥmūd ʿAbbās
 and is of good quality. Individual hadith are ordered only by numbers which have been untagged 
 as headers but retained as paragraphs. Only volumes have been preserved as tagged headers. There
 is an anomaly in the numbering of these volumes (the "first" of the seventh volume comes between 
 volumes four and five) but this is consistent with the printed edition and the hadith numbering 
 continues uninterrupted. Digital file also includes an extensive editorial introduction 
 at the start.
