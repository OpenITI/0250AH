90#VERS#COMMENT##: Digital edition is based on the edition by Waṣī Allāh
    b. Maḥmūd ʿAbbās and is of good quality. Individual hadith are ordered
    only by numbers which have been untagged  as headers but retained as
    paragraphs. Only volumes have been preserved as tagged headers. There is
    an anomaly in the numbering of these volumes (the "first" of the seventh
    volume comes between  volumes four and five) but this is consistent with
    the printed edition and the hadith numbering  continues uninterrupted.
    Digital file also includes an extensive editorial introduction  at the
    start.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
