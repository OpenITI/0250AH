90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The name of the publisher in METADATA is probably
    wrong. “مكتبة الرشد” has published this book, but by some other editors
    (not by the one mentioned here), and also in 16 volumes (not in 7). See
    this link: http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/85891404. 2- Some words are
    added in triple parenthesis (i.e. ((()))) into the text that do not
    exist in the PDF. In most cases, they are corrections; but sometimes
    they are strange and I didn’t understand what they really are. 3- The
    editorial section in PageV07P564 is the note of the scribe.
