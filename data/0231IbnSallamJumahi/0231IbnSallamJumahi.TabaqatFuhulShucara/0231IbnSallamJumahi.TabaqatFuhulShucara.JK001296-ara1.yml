90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- There are four names at the beginning of each
            chapter that do not include any information, but I have tagged them as
            ### $. This is because the information regarding these persons and their
            poems appears in the following pages. The author first names four poets
            at the beginning of each chapter and then presents some information
            about them in the rest of the chapter (sometimes in a disordered style
            and in combination with other information about poetry in general and
            …). I used this pattern for all chapters. Moreover, I have tagged the
            names of the poets in the beginning of each chapter (i.e. NOT inside the
            chapter at the beginning of their respective poems). There are two
            reasons for this: firstly, the names appear in complete form just in the
            beginning of each chapter. Inside the chapter they appear just in short
            form (i.e. without any Kunya and Nasab). Secondly, some of the names
            don’t have any explanation at all in the text and are just mentioned to
            complete the categorization. 2- Numbers 523-532 are lost in the text.
            But this is the problem of the book not Editpro version (As it is
            explained on page 522 of the PDF). 3- The book consists of two parts,
            but it seems to me that it is one volume (the page numbers are
            continuous both in the PDF and Editpro version). So, maybe it’s better
            to change the pagination.
            NB: check lines of poetry that seem too short: line numbers 220, 326, 688,
            690, 697, 699, 713, 775, 1468, 1725, 1773, 2369, 2700, 3322, 3343, 3729, 3795,
            4279, 5419, 5505, 5531
            NB: check lines of poetry that seem too long: line numbers 2251, 5709
    All paratextual elements
